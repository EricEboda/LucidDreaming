        <h1>Lucid Dreaming</h1>
        <h3>#1 Website to practice Lucid Dreaming</p>
        <h2>What is Lucid Dreaming?</h2>
        <p>A lucid dream is a dream during which the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming.
        During a lucid dream, the dreamer may gain some amount of control over the dream characters,
        narrative, and environment; however, this is not actually necessary for a dream to be described as lucid.</p>

        <h2>How to Lucid Dream</h2>
        <p>So how do you Lucid Dream? If you are planning to become a lucid dreamer and are willing to work for it.
        These are the three things that will get you there. These three things by themselves, followed religiously will get you lucid.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Begin keeping a dream journal.</b> Any time you wake up, at night or in the morning, write down what you remember. 
            At night a sentence often stimulates enough memory to remember more in the morning. 
            Record things that occur often. These will be your dream signs. Goal: Remember 1 or 2 dreams each night.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Begin doing reality checks</b> Reality checks are when you question your state of awareness. Ask yourself "Am I in a dream?" all the time throughout the day.
            <b>Really</b> question your state, and these habits will carry over into your dream. This is what will help you realise that you are dreaming.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Begin practicing MILD (Mind Induced Lucid Dreaming).</b>Before you go to bed, tell yourself that you intend to remember that you are dreaming while in your dream.
                Every time you wake up at night, remember a dream you have had or just had. Pick one in which a dream-sign appears. 
                (This is one of the reasons your use a dream journal.) Remind yourself again that you intend to remember that are dreaming while in your dream. 
                In the visualization, see yourself in the dream you picked noticing the dream-sign. Upon noticing the dream sign, do a reality check. See yourself becoming lucid. 
                Then continue visualizing what you plan to do once you become lucid. Condition yourself this way so that you expect it to happen and the training kicks in 
                as automatically as catching a line drive and throwing it to second base when there is a guy on first, 'cause you don't want to miss a double play like last time. 
                And the pitcher is Jeff from fourth grade but he is still 10 years old. That's weird. Note: This is best done in the early morning when you wake up.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Continue to do the above things until you have success--this is the method in which most beginners have success.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Begin 1 and 2 simultaneously. Once You have reached remembering 1 or 2 dreams each night and have pulled out some good dream signs from your journal, start 3.</p>
