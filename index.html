        <h2>What is Lucid Dreaming?</h2>
        <p>A lucid dream is a dream during which the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming.
        During a lucid dream, the dreamer may gain some amount of control over the dream characters,
        narrative, and environment; however, this is not actually necessary for a dream to be described as lucid.</p>
